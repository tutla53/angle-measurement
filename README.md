## Introduction
In this work we present a soft continuum manipulator with two actuated DOFs: <br> 
1. Bending on an arbitrary plane (<i>&theta;</i>).
2. Rotation of the bending plane with respect to a fixed reference frame (<i>&gamma;</i>).

Typically, bending angle (<i>&theta;</i>) and rotation of bending plane angle (<i>&gamma;</i>) are measured by attaching a sensor 
(e.g. [electromagnetic tracking](https://www.ndigital.com/technology/em-overview/))
at the tip of the continuum robot, usually called as proprioceptive sensor. However, the sensor installation is challenging because of the limited area of the tip and may affect the overall stiffness.
And also, the sensor is relatively expensive, with costs ranging from $5000 - $150,000 <sup> [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-381496-8.00001-9) </sup>.
Therefore, the use of a non-contact measurement type (e.g. camera) will resolve the problem of the proprioceptive sensor.
