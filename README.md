# Soft Robot's Angle Measurement Program with OpenCV
***
This repository is associated with the research collaboration program between Imperial College London and Institut Teknologi Bandung in the field of affordable medical devices based on `soft robotics`.

## Introduction
In this work we present a soft continuum manipulator with two actuated DOFs: <br> 
1. Bending on an arbitrary plane (&theta;).
2. Rotation of the bending plane with respect to a fixed reference frame (&gamma;).

To characterize the behaviour of the robot, both angles are needed to be measured.
